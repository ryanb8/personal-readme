## TLDR;
- I strive to be a creator and an educator over being a data scientist, analyst, researcher, leader, etc.
- I am mathematical, introverted, and task-driven.
- I love clarity and consensus and am happy to talk through problems, conflict, and ambiguity to achieve this. I excel at this when problems are technical in nature or ALL parties are mutually striving towards consensus and clarity. As soon as discussion becomes tense, political (in terms of office politics), or it becomes clear that resolution isn't obtainable (or worse, desired) I will wear out quickly.
- Please be sensitive to my "flow" - I work in a deep flow and interruptions crush my productivity.
  - If you need my help or time, send me a slack message or schedule a meeting on my calendar and tell me in that message/cal invite **what** you want my help with. Don't just ask if I have a second to chat with you.

## Thanks for looking at my readme!

My name is Ryan Boyer and I'm currently a Principal Data Scientist at Shipt. I'm a big believer in clarity in communication and relationships. I want my coworkers and friends to know who I am, how I function, what my faults and skills are, and how to interact with me for mutual success. 

This document aims to provide quick insight about these things. It is a living document. People grow and change over time, and I am no exception. 

### What has been my role as a "Data Scientist"?

In title, my role has always been along the lines of "Data Scientist". In practice, I usually end up doing a little bit of everything.

For example, in my time at Shipt, I have:
- Built several productionalized machine learning models (solutions to the cold-start problem in search, subscription churn, suggested substitutions, out-of-stock item prediction, etc.)
- Engineered an advanced data pipeline to track subscription information and generate core reports on this data
- Built and maintained internal tools (deployment code, infrastructure code, R & python packages)
- Trained and onboarded new team members and educated them about Shipt's process and workflows
- Advised data science projects both in formal and informal roles
- Acted as a sounding board and brainstorming companion for data scientists, engineers, and others
- Served as interim tech leader for several data science team members
- Worked on projects that address concerns of operations, accounting, finance, marketing, search, member, shopper, and retailer (basically all core groups at Shipt)

At the end of the day, I know my job is always to help the company succeed and to help my teammates improve and succeed; this is what I view as my role. 

### What should you know about me?
- **I'm an introvert** 
- I think of myself as a **creator** and **educator** over other terms like leader, researcher, manager, or analyst. This doesn't mean I don't fill these other roles, but building things and teaching people are what really bring me joy.
- I love learning new things, and I learn best by doing. My preferred learning method is self-guided reading, tinkering, and writing. Even if I understand something, I don't feel like I've learned it until I have time to explore it solo (so be patient with me!)
- I'm very **task driven** - I always have a to-do list and am always trying to scratch things off of it. If I'm not accomplishing as much as I planned to accomplish or feel like I should be accomplishing, then I can start feeling low. The more stressed I am, the more task oriented I get.
- While I'm doing tasks in the present, I'm always thinking, dreaming, and ideating about the future.
- I'm a big believer in documentation of projects and code. A project isn't really done until it is well documented.
- I love sharing knowledge, through documentation, discussions, or q&A.
- **At my core, I think of myself as a mathematician** - high level mathematics is all about discovering or creating abstract objects, studying how they behave in various circumstances, categorizing them appropriately, and proving their nature concretely. (I have been known to do mathematics on vacation for fun ðŸ˜±). This interacts with work in several ways:
  - I *can* be very **pedantic** and **pursue ideals over solutions**
  - Words and definitions really matter to me. This is especially true when I feel that clarity is on the line. However, when I feel confident that everyone has a purer understanding of whatever abstract concept we are discussing than can be expressed in words, I can become sloppy with *my* words in an effort to convey ideas quickly. (This rarely goes well for me...)
  - I like things that I do to be polished and elegant, not just working.
  - People are very different than mathematics; I will quickly be mentally/emotionally drained by office politics, mixed project direction/signals, and un-concrete plans.
  - I really enjoy the computer science aspect of DS. (Computer Science is all about abstract objects and their behavior in strange circumstances.)
- I have my life outside of work planned out days in advance - if you want me to join you for lunch or drinks, I'll probably say no if you don't tell me several days ahead of time.
- I'm a **huge advocate of work-life integration**. I try to actively encourage coworkers to fight for a sustainable job and career by prioritizing their own selves.
- I need **exercise** and **time in nature** to function well - tell me to go for a run if I seem really stressed or short.

### How do I work?
- **I work in a very deep [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) and I'm terrible at task-switching** 
- I arrive between 8am and 9am
- I leave between 5pm and 6p
- I do my very best to not work at all after these hours (and I want to support you doing this too!)

### How do I communicate?
- I have lots of opinions and usually think I'm right 
- I like to think out loud - I try to clarify when I am brainstorming versus stating facts. Feel free to ask for clarification!
  - I am not offended if you tell me to be quiet!
- I don't have any shame admitting when I'm wrong (and actually pride myself on my drive to do this!)
- If I slack you after hours, I really, really, really, really hope you don't respond. This is just a way for me to declutter my mind and not forget things.

### How should you communicate with me?
- **Give me a heads up before you need my help**
  - Send me a slack message or schedule a meeting on my calendar and tell me in that message/cal invite **what** you want my help with. 
  - Don't just ask if I have a second to chat with you.
    - Good Example: "Ryan, do you have 5 minutes today for me to ask you a question about the day 0 search algorithm"
    - Bad Example: "You have a second to chat?"
- **Please** don't tap me on the shoulder
- Know that I'm not going to respond to your slack message or email after hours.


### How can I help you work better and achieve more?
- Ask me for help on projects or ideas! I'm happy to share my perspective, experience, and brainstorm with you. Even though I likely won't know the "answer" I believe that I'll learn from brainstorming with you and, hopefully, you can learn from me.
- Always provide context to me when asking a question - even if you asked me a question on the same topic via slack 15 minutes ago.
- If you want advice on a problem just ask, but be prepared! I don't like just "doing" things; I'm much more likely to try to make it so that you can solve a similar problem in the future without me. This means I'll probably ask you lots of questions in helping you.
